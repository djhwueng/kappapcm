what to do with people who don't say thanks

new research on gratitude training shows how even an ingrate can change

you have gone out of your way to help someone you don't know sll that well but have always liked
expecting gratitude for your kindness you instead get a complaint 
this person you helped feels that you didnot actually do quite enough and accuses you of only looking out for your own best interests
perhaps instead this person becomes angry stating that the help wan't needed and that you are being patronizing 
te act of kindness on your part could have involed the simple gesture of lending a hand while this person tried to juggle an armful of shoppong bags or providin more substantial help
such as a loan of 100 in either case it is clear your gesture didn't produce the antipate outcome of a simple thanks

some people just say thanks for everything such as thanks at the end of an email or text regardless of the content of the message however expressing thus superficial and even automatic type of apparent gratitude probably doesnot strike you as all that sincere when people show true gratitude they have to go farther than just saying th word


berger suggest that people who don't express gratitude aew missing out as an important potential source of fullfillment
